# 🧠 Companion README: Simulation-Resonance Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis

Welcome to the companion guide for the draft paper:

**"A Simulation-Resonance Framework for Proving the Riemann Hypothesis"**

This README provides a contextual overview of the ideas behind the paper, what it aims to show, and how to navigate the contents.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project introduces a novel method of proving the **Riemann Hypothesis (RH)** by interpreting the zeta function as a *resonance field* within a structured arithmetic simulation.

We blend:
- **Operator theory**
- **Spectral analysis**
- **Prime lattice phase interference**
- **Symbolic simulation logic**

The result is a proof-by-contradiction showing that RH must be true **to maintain stability of the simulation’s internal arithmetic coherence**.

## 📘 Key Concepts

### Prime-Resonance Space (\( \mathcal{R} \))
A function space of complex phase values assigned to each prime, structured by a weighted inner product.

### Resonance Operator (\( H \))
An operator built from a symmetric kernel encoding prime-to-prime interference. This operator is:
- Self-adjoint
- Spectrally tied to ζ(s) zeros
- Phase-sensitive

### Core Insight
Off-line zeros (not on \( \text{Re}(s) = 1/2 \)) break the kernel symmetry ⇒ the operator is no longer Hermitian ⇒ contradiction with known properties of ζ(s) and the prime-counting function.
